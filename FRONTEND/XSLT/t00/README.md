# XSLT Test Problem
Try to transform XSL to HTML
</br>
<hr>
Don't even ask, buddy, very few people from my environment have worked with XSLT, so it was decided to smoke manual.

1. The problem I faced with, was naive thinking that everything would work just by running it from a folder in the browser. By sheer luck I have a LIVE SERVER, and it worked, but it's all from the lack of understanding of the subtleties of technology.</br>

2. The second problem is the implicit nesting in the XSLT file, the documentation points out only a point example but does not cover the entire file, this is a problem, it was decided to look at other repositories on GitHub with similar solutions, so far the result is negative.</br>
